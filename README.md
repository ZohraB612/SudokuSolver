## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
    ```

2. Run the program using Python.

    ```bash
    python sudoku_solver.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to input the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve.

## Example

Suppose you have the following Sudoku puzzle:

```bash
0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 4 0 9 0
0 0 4 0 7 0 0 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 3 0 7 9
7 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 4
9 2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 9 0 1 0 0
0 3 0 4 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0
```

The program will solve it and display the solution:

```bash
2 7 9 6 5 8 3 4 1
3 8 6 1 2 4 7 9 5
5 1 4 3 7 9 8 2 6
6 4 1 2 8 3 5 7 9
7 5 3 9 1 6 2 8 4
9 2 8 5 4 7 6 1 3
4 6 2 7 9 5 1 3 8
8 3 7 4 6 1 9 5 2
1 9 5 8 3 2 4 6 7
```

## How it Works

The Sudoku Solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution. It starts by trying to fill in each cell with a number between 1 and 9. If a number is valid, it proceeds to the next cell. If a number is not valid, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number.

The program also checks if a number is valid by ensuring it doesn't already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 grid.

## Dependencies

This program only uses Python's standard libraries and does not require any external dependencies.
